## Purpose of this project

Learning Design patterns, UI design, and designing Data model.
Mostly just for fun. Learning Blazor.

Some came to influence work that I was doing at the time.

I chose to populate the site with coffee and pastries because I was thinking of the apps of popular coffee shops when designing the system - and I love coffee!
